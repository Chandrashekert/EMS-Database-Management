This is a project I made to showcase some SQL-based data analysis, data cleaning, and data visualization. The concept revolves around Emergency Medical Services which I used as an inspiration along with hospital and medical professionals for a project on Database Management. I took several creative liberties (data-wise) to accommodate proper database management. However, it does not have any major effects on the data analysis work, which is the key factor to this project. 


**This project is currently in a POWERPOINT format, but it will soon be uploaded properly as an SQL file.**
